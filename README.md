<h1 align="center">Welcome To The Red Abyss</h1>

This is the **Red Abyss**, a hellscape prison where you and others fight to the death to feel a little less imprisoned in your hellish captivity. 

### Why It Was Made
I chose the name because it was just a menacing cool name for a map, and when I think of this game from the experience I have of playing it, it is that this world in Quake is pretty hardcore and very familiar to Doom. This was made to show my expertise in using Trenchbroom to make a custom map for the first time. I have never done anything like this before, it feels like making a mod for a game, it is pretty exciting for me to be working on this game. I chose to make a prison level because it is a place where you are unable to escape, unable to leave from, and you can't even see the outside world in some ruthless prisons, which is how I want the players to feel as they blow each other up in the battle to the death, a repeated endless battle to the death that is.

The emphasis on the color red is a major contribution as it helps represent that this place is not just a normal prison especially when I'm making this map for Quake.
