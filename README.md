<h1 align="center">Welcome To The Red Abyss</h1>

This is the **Red Abyss**, a hellscape prison where you and others fight to the death to feel a little less imprisoned in your hellish captivity. 

### Why It Was Made
I chose the name because it was just a menacing cool name for a map, and when I think of this game from the experience I have of playing it, it is that this world in Quake is pretty hardcore and very familiar to Doom. This was made to show my expertise in using Trenchbroom to make a custom map for the first time. I have never done anything like this before, it feels like making a mod for a game, it is pretty exciting for me to be working on this game. I chose to make a prison level because it is a place where you are unable to escape, unable to leave from, and you can't even see the outside world in some ruthless prisons, which is how I want the players to feel as they blow each other up in the battle to the death, a repeated endless battle to the death that is.

The emphasis on the color red is a major contribution as it helps represent that this place is not just a normal prison especially when I'm making this map for Quake. 

### Progression
There has nothing been as hellish as the progress of this map, which sadly because it has been so difficult to work on the maps and even test them for so long. I have not been able to keep track when it came to images but I can explain my struggles just even learning how to use Trenchbroom. What was painful was the fact that I had trouble compiling and launching the game because there were constant errors as I figured out what I wanted to design at my level, but I never seemed to give up. The design was probably the best part of working on this because it felt nice when I saw what the finalized version was gonna look like and it made me dedicated to pushing through and making it even though I was unable to test it out.

This was obvious when I had a round played in the first testing of it, and the map only had 1/3 of the stuff I added to the map and yet there was some charm to it. What was disappointing was I really wanted the players to see what I've built and that made me learn that I really got to lock in and figure out my shit. I really had to start testing my map and make sure I could compile the whole thing. This is how I got here, now releasing my map so yeah everything went well.
